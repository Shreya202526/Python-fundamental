'''7. Remove Duplicate Words from a String

Voice Assistant Noise Correction System

A voice assistant records spoken commands from users.

Due to microphone disturbance and network lag, some words are repeated multiple times.

The company wants a Python program that removes duplicate words while maintaining the original order.

``
hello hello how are are you


Output:


hello how are you'''

s=input("Enter the String:")
new_string=s.split()
result=""
i=0
while i<len(new_string):
      ch=new_string[i]
      if ch not in result:
            result=result+new_string[i]+" "
      i=i+1
print(result)
