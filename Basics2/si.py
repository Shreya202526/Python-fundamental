'''A bank wants to help customers calculate the simple interest on their savings.

Write a Python program that:
- Accepts principal amount, rate of interest, and time (in years) as input.
- Calculates the simple interest using the formula:
  SI = (P × R × T) / 100
- Displays the simple interest.

Example:
Principal = 1000
Rate = 5
Time = 2
Simple Interest = 100.0'''



p,r,t=map(int,input("enter principal,rate,time:").split(","))
si=(p*r*t)/100
print(f" Principal=  {p}\n Rate= {r}\n Time={t}\n Simple Interest ={si}")
