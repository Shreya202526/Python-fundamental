''' You and your friends went out to eat. The bill was quite high and you want to split it evenly.

Write a Python program that:
- Accepts the total bill amount.
- Accepts the number of friends.
- Displays how much each person should pay.

Example:
Total bill = 1250
Friends = 5
Each should pay = 250.0'''


total_bill=int(input("Total bill="))
friends=int(input("friends="))
each_pay=total_bill/friends
print("Each should pay=",each_pay)
